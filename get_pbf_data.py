"""
Enrich offroad routes for specific counties in Utah using a local OSM PBF file,
Pyrosm, OSMnx, and GeoPandas, with a custom filter.

This script:
  - Loads a local PBF file (using a full path, e.g., "/Users/baguettebandit/onx-offroad-route/data/utah.osm.pbf").
  - Uses OSMnx to retrieve county boundaries.
  - Uses Pyrosm's get_data_by_custom_criteria() to extract highway features
    (with highway values matching our criteria) from the entire PBF file.
  - Clips the extracted features to the county boundary.
  - Applies additional post-filters to enforce:
      ‚Ä¢ "motor_vehicle" is not "no",
      ‚Ä¢ "access" is not "private", "customers", or "restricted",
      ‚Ä¢ "surface" is one of "gravel", "dirt", or "unpaved".
  - Merges the results and writes out an enriched GeoJSON file.
  
Ensure:
  - You have installed Pyrosm (pip install pyrosm), OSMnx, GeoPandas, and pandas.
  - You have downloaded an OSM PBF file (e.g., for Utah) and set the correct full path.
